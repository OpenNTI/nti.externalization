Externalization support for things that implement the interfaces
of :mod:`zope.dublincore.interfaces`.

.. note::
   We are "namespacing" the dublincore properties, since they have
   defined meanings we don't control. We are currently doing this by simply prefixing
   them with 'DC' for ease of access in JavaScript.

These objects are typically used as decorators, registered
from ZCML.
